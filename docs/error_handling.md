# Error handling
* Models should return return codes.
* Core/database methods: Detailed error messages are only shown if ``SYRACUSE_DEBUG`` is set to true (/index.php). These error messages are then printed directly to the screen.
* Other methods: If more detailed error messages are needed, add a function parameter (an array passed by reference) to pass error messages to
* Error messages are generated by the controller based on the return code provided by the model. However, this does not apply to fatal error messages, which are printed directly to the screen (since the script is terminated directly after).
